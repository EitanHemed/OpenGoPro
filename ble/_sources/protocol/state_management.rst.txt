State Management
****************

Camera Readiness
================

Depending on the camera's state, it may not be ready to accept specific commands. This ready state is dependent on the
`System Busy <../features/statuses.html#status_8>`_
and `Encoding Active <../features/statuses.html#status_10>`_ status flags. For example:

- System Busy flag is set while loading presets, changing settings, formatting sdcard, ...
- Encoding Active flag is set while capturing photo/video media

If the system is not ready, it should reject an incoming command; however, best practice is to always wait for the
System Busy and Encode Active flags to be unset before sending messages other than get status/setting queries.

Keep Alive
==========

Unless changed by the user, GoPro cameras will automatically power off after some time (e.g. 5min, 15min, 30min).
Therefore, it is necessary to periodically send a `keep alive <../features/control.html#keep_alive>`_  signal to maintain the connection.

Camera Control
==============

In order to prevent undefined behavior between the camera and a connected app, simultaneous use of the camera and a
connected app is discouraged. A third party client should use
`Set Camera Control <../features/control.html#set_camera_control>`_
to tell the camera that the client wishes to claim control of the camera.
