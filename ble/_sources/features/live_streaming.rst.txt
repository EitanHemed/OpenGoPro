Live Streaming
==============

The camera supports the ability to stream to social media platforms such as Twitch, YouTube, Facebook or any other site
that accepts RTMP(S) URLs.

For additional details about getting started with RTMP, see
`How to Stream <https://gopro.com/en/us/news/how-to-live-stream-on-gopro>`__.

Live streaming with camera is accomplished as follows:

1. Put the camera into :doc:`Station Mode<access_points>` and connect it to an access point
2. Set the `Livestream Mode <live_streaming.html#set_livestream_mode>`__
3. Poll for `Livestream Status <live_streaming.html#get_livestream_status>`__ until the camera indicates it is ready
4. Set the shutter to begin live streaming
5. Unset the shutter to stop live streaming
