This page will detail operations to command and control the GoPro.

Operations
----------

.. operation:tlv-command:: Keep Alive
    :id: 0x5B

    In order to maximize battery life, GoPro cameras automatically go to sleep after some time. This logic is handled by
    a combination of the `Auto Power Down <../features/settings.html#setting_59>`_
    setting which most (but not all) cameras support and a Keep Alive message that the user can regularly send to the
    camera. The camera will automatically go to sleep if both timers reach zero.

    The Auto Power Down timer is reset when the user taps the LCD screen, presses a button on the camera,
    programmatically (un)sets the shutter, sets a setting, or loads a Preset.

    The Keep Alive timer is reset when the user sends a keep alive message.

    The best practice to prevent the camera from inadvertently going to sleep is to start sending Keep Alive
    messages every 3.0 seconds after a connection is established.

    .. operation:tlv-message:: Request
        :uuid: Setting
        :params:
            - keep_alive (uint8): hard-coded data set to 0x42
    .. operation:tlv-message:: Response
        :uuid: Settings Response

.. operation:tlv-command:: Set Analytics
    :id: 0x50

    Configure the client as third-party for analytic tracking.

    .. operation:tlv-message:: Request
        :uuid: Command
    .. operation:tlv-message:: Response
        :uuid: Command Response

.. operation:tlv-command:: Set AP Control
    :id: 0x17

    Enable / disable the camera's WiFi access point.

    .. operation:tlv-message:: Request
        :uuid: Command
        :params:
            - mode (uint8) : 0 to disable, 1 to enable
    .. operation:tlv-message:: Response
        :uuid: Command Response

.. operation:protobuf:: Set Camera Control
    :unsupported: boilers

    .. image:: ../../assets/images/global_behaviors.png

    .. operation:protobuf-message:: request
        :feature-id: 0xF1
        :action-id: 0x69
        :uuid: Command
        :message: WSDK_RequestSetCameraControlStatus

    .. operation:protobuf-message:: response
        :feature-id: 0xF1
        :action-id: 0xE9
        :uuid: Command Response
        :message: ResponseGeneric

.. operation:tlv-command:: Set Date Time
    :id: 0x0D

    Set the camera's date and time (without timezone and daylight-savings information).

    The **date_time** parameter is a 7 byte value defined as such:

    - uint16 year
    - uint8 month (1-12)
    - uint8 day (1-31)
    - uint8 hour (0-23)
    - uint8 minute (0-59)
    - uint8 second (0-59)

    For example, date time "2023-01-31 03:04:05" is serialized as **07:e7:01:1f:03:04:05**

    .. operation:tlv-message:: Request
        :uuid: Command
        :params:
            - date_time (7 byte date_time defined above): Date time to set
    .. operation:tlv-message:: Response
        :uuid: Command Response

.. operation:tlv-command:: Set Local Date Time
    :id: 0x0F
    :unsupported: boilers kongs

    Set the cameras date and time with timezone and daylight-savings information.

    The **date_time** parameter is a 10 byte value defined as such:

    - uint16 year
    - uint8 month (1-12)
    - uint8 day (1-31)
    - uint8 hour (0-23)
    - uint8 minute (0-59)
    - uint8 second (0-59)
    - int16 `UTC offset <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UTC_offsets>`__ in minutes
    - uint8 is_dst (1 if daylight savings time is enabled, 0 otherwise)

    For example, date time "2023-01-31 03:04:05 (utc-02:00) (dst: on)" is serialized as **07:E7:01:1F:03:04:05:FF:88:01**

    .. operation:tlv-message:: Request
        :uuid: Command
        :params:
            - date_time (10 byte date_time defined above): Date time to set
    .. operation:tlv-message:: Response
        :uuid: Command Response

.. operation:tlv-command:: Set Shutter
    :id: 0x01

    Set Shutter On / Off

    .. operation:tlv-message:: Request
        :uuid: Command
        :params:
            - mode (uint8) : 0 for off, 1 for on
    .. operation:tlv-message:: Response
        :uuid: Command Response

.. operation:protobuf:: Set Turbo Transfer

    .. operation:protobuf-message:: request
        :feature-id: 0xF1
        :action-id: 0x6B
        :uuid: Command
        :message: WSDK_RequestSetTurboActive

    .. operation:protobuf-message:: response
        :feature-id: 0xF1
        :action-id: 0xEB
        :uuid: Command Response
        :message: ResponseGeneric

.. operation:tlv-command:: Sleep
    :id: 0x05

    Put the camera to sleep.

    .. note:: The camera is still be connectable via BLE in sleep.

    .. operation:tlv-message:: Request
        :uuid: Command
    .. operation:tlv-message:: Response
        :uuid: Command Response
